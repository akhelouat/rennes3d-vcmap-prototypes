# Rollup Plugin VCS OL
This plugin will rewrite _any imports_ to the openalyers `ol` module
with named imports from the `vcMAP` openlayers dump file.

#### Why?
This allows for resource sharing when writing plugins for the `vcMAP`, since 
all plugins and the map share the same external `ol` source.
